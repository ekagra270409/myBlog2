        <br>
        <p>Speaking like mobiles like Samsung and others, Android is the main rival of Apple said by more tech viewers because it has power of all non-Apple phones for their operating systems. The company's OS started in 2008(1 year after iPhone was introduced) which unleashed lots of users to by these Android phones in the tech-race. Everyone who was n't having an iPhone or having an phone with no pwered OS, Android was producing a lot of phones by taking over many phone-making companies like Nokia, Vivo, Oppo, Realme, OnePlus, Lava, Motorola and also Samsung. Android has a lot best-selling OS operating phones. We should now see that who will win the race-Apple or Android?</p>

        <img class="logo" src="nokia%20logo.png">
        <br>
        <p>Before Android and Apple's best-selling mobiles that we always use, we also think about those hand-shaking Nokia logos on our phone. in older days, they made the best-selling cell phones where we can play games or text in a Monoscaped font. Nokia was the only company that made cell phones more fun for people and connecting people of all ages. But when Android phones and the best-selling iPhones came in the digital world, Nokia got broke and wanted to go to Android but they don't want a lot of phones to jump in their personal space so Nokia decided to go to Microsoft and merge with them so they can make new best-sellers. They made flat iPad mini-shaped smartphones that few people buyed and both got broke. Now, Nokia has no more Microsoft-powered phones anymore. They have their own phones by Andorid that are also bestselling.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Finally let us go to Nokia's ex-merger Microsoft that only operates on Computers. This company was founded by the world's former richest person Bill Gates. They have power to operate their OS i.e. Windows on all computer companies like Lenovo, Acer, HP, Dell, HTC, etc. The company also has an offline work system called Office that has Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. We can also use the MS Office on our Mac and Macbooks too.</p>
